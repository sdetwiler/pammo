Working on adding PHP support. Need to export objects that expose
methods to call into ds.

Basically the PHP API is a pile of shit. DO NOT CODE WITH MACROS.  The
code is unreadable, undebuggable and plain stupid. The examples online
use the same style, so it's all impossible to follow. The DS extension
is a mess at the moment, but it's time to stop for now. Keep unwinding
the borrowed macros and work from there.

all that.

Build MySQL Interface
	Server done
	Database done
	Next is Table
		Built as Query class done

Should ConnectionPool retain a secondary index of Servers for garbage
collection?

Build schema for DB storage

	id		// Unique id for the object.
	oid		// Id for the type of objec.
	createdTime	// When the object was created.
	modifiedTime	// When the object was last modified.
